### ðŸ§ª Data Quality Fixes

- âœ… **Patient IDs** were converted from scientific/decimal format using power Query.
- âœ… **Age** with value `-1` was replaced with `0`
- âœ… **Checked for missing values** â€“ none found
- âœ… **Checked for duplicates** â€“ none found
- âœ… **Date & Time columns** (`scheduled_day`, `appointment_day`, `scheduled_time`, `appointment_time`) were formatted cleanly
- âœ… **Neighbourhood values** were reviewed and encoded properly (e.g., accented characters preserved)
